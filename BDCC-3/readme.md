## Assignment 3

This assignment is about measuring the performance using Redis caching on Azure. Users can interact with the performance measurement service through web page interfaces.

### Features
- Import earthquake data from the USGS website or census data from the Census Bureau, into an SQL database.
- Allow users to specify parameters for random and restricted queries through a web interface.
- Measure the time expended to execute random and restricted queries on the datasets.
- Display the results of query performance measurements to users.
- Implement buffering/caching mechanisms using either memcache or Redis to optimize query performance.
- Repeat query performance measurements after implementing buffering/caching mechanisms and compare results.
