## Assignment 5

This assignment involves building a cloud-based solution for text search and retrieval, focusing on processing and querying text documents stored in a cloud environment on Azure. Users can interact with the system to search for relevant documents based on their queries.

### Features
- Import a collection of text documents into the system, cleaning and preprocessing them for efficient searching.
- Enable users to search for documents based on specific words or combinations of words, returning relevant documents and their locations.
- Implement text processing techniques such as converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and eliminating common stop words to enhance search accuracy.
- Support more functionalities, including searching for bi-grams (pairs of adjacent words) and tri-grams (triplets of adjacent words) to capture more nuanced queries.
- Offer optimizations such as handling word transpositions and missing or transposed letters in search queries to improve search results.
- Provide a user-friendly web interface for allowing users to input queries and view matching documents.
