The scene room small Sussex manor house that has long been 
for sale It such silent room that whoever speaks first here 
bold one unless indeed he merely mutters himself which they 
perhaps allow All of this room s past which can be taken away has 
gone Such light as there comes from only window which at 
back and incompletely shrouded sacking For moment this 
mellow light and if photograph could be taken quickly we might 
find disturbing smile on room s face perhaps like Mona 
Lisa s which came surely of her knowing what only dead should 
know There are two doors one leading downstairs other at 
back very insignificant though it centre of this disturbing 
history The wall paper heavy adherence of other papers of 
still older date has peeled and leans forward here and there 
grotesque bow as men have hung chains one might predict that 
next sound heard here will be distant future when another piece 
of paper loosens Save for two packing cases only furniture 
worn easy chair doddering by unlit fire like some foolish old 
man We might play with disquieting fancy that this room once 
warm with love still alive but shrinking from observation and 
that with our departure they cunningly set again at apparently 
never ending search which goes on some empty old houses 

Some one heard clumping up stair and caretaker enters It 
not she however who clumps she has been here for several years 
and has become sufficiently part of house move noiselessly 
it The first thing we know about her that she does not like 
be this room She elderly woman of gaunt frame and with 
singular control over herself There may be some one somewhere who 
can make her laugh still one never knows but effort would hurt 
her face Even war lately ended meant very little her She 
has shown number of possible purchasers over house just as she 
showing one over it now with true caretaker s indifference 
whether you buy or not The few duties imposed on her here she performs 
conscientiously but her greatest capacity for sitting still 
dark Her work over her mind blank she sits thus rather than pay 
for candle One knows little more about life when he knows Mrs 
Oterys but she herself unaware that she peculiar and probably 
thinks that some such way do people general pass hour before 
bedtime Nevertheless though saving of her candle other empty 
houses she always lights it on approach of evening this one 

The man who has clumped up stairs her wake young 
Australian soldier private such as those days you met by 
dozen any London street slouching along it forlornly if alone 
with sudden stoppages pass time which you ran against 
him or affable converse with young lady In his voice 
Australian tang that became such friendly sound us He rough 
fellow sinewy with clear eye of man with axe whose chief 
life struggle till war came was fell trees and see it that 
they did not crash down on him Mrs Otery showing him house 
which he has evidently known other days but though interested he 
unsentimental and looks about him with tolerant grin 

cloud computing 
MRS OTERY Whatever it she prowls about this cold house searching 
for searching searching I don t know what it 

HARRY grimly Maybe I could tell you I dare say I could even put 
her way of finding him 

MRS OTERY Then I wish God you would and let her rest 

HARRY My old dear there are worse things than not finding what you 
are looking for there finding them so different from what you had 
hoped He moves about A ghost Oh no and yet and yet See here 
I am going into that room 

MRS OTERY As you like I care not 

HARRY I ll burst open door 

MRS OTERY No need it s not locked I cheated you about that 

HARRY But I tried it and it wouldn t open 

MRS OTERY very unhappy

HARRY taking deep breath Give me air 

He throws open window and we see that it night of stars 

Leave me here now I have call make 

MRS OTERY hesitating I dunno You think you re no danger 
but 

HARRY That how it be missis Just ten minutes you were out 
of room did you say 

MRS OTERY That was all 

HARRY God 

She leaves him After moment s irresolution he sets off upon his 
quest carrying candle which takes with it all light of 
room He visible on other side of darkness little 
passage and opening door beyond He returns and now we see 
pale ghost of MARY ROSE standing middle of room as if 
made out of light he has brought back with him 

MARY ROSE bowing him timidly Have you come buy house 

HARRY more startled by his own voice than by hers Not me 

MARY ROSE It very nice house Doubtfully Isn t it 

HARRY It was nice house once 

MARY ROSE pleased Wasn t it Suspiciously Did you know this 
house 

HARRY When I was young shaver 

MARY ROSE Young Was it you who laughed 

HARRY When was that 

MARY ROSE puzzled There was once some one who laughed this 
house Don t you think laughter very pretty sound 

HARRY out of his depths Is it I dare say I never thought about 
it 

MARY ROSE You are quite old 

HARRY I m getting on 

MARY ROSE confidentially Would you mind telling me why every one 
so old I don t know you do I 

HARRY I wonder Take look You might have seen me old 
days playing about outside garden or even inside 

MARY ROSE You you are not Simon are you
