## Assignment 2

This assignment entails creating a cloud-based solution for storing, querying, and analyzing earthquake data using SQL databases on Azure. Users can interact with the system to perform insightful queries and gain valuable insights into seismic activity.

### Features
- Import earthquake data sourced from the USGS website into an SQL database hosted on Azure.
- Conduct queries to retrieve earthquakes based on magnitude, location, and time parameters.
- Analyze earthquake occurrences across different magnitude ranges, aiding in understanding seismic trends.
- Identify earthquakes near specified geographic coordinates, enabling targeted analysis of seismic events.
- Detect clusters of earthquakes occurring within close temporal and spatial proximity, facilitating the identification of seismic hotspots.
- Investigate temporal patterns of earthquake occurrences, including time-of-day and day-of-week trends.
